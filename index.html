         <h3>Free Code Camp Backend Challenges and a Commentary</h3>
         <p>Blog for #100DaysOfCode</p>
         <p>Day 1: Chose Freecodecamp and figured out I will do the backend course. Setup Git, Git Desktop, and Git pages.</p>
         <p>Day 2: Started with editing package.json on a backend challenge. I can't still figure out how to submit the challenge correctly.</p>
         <p>Day 3: Got my http://lpninja.github.io stack up and continuing to write here. Still stuck on their submission form. Have asked them. Smeagol responded. Apparently you cannot use static pages like Git Pages and need to use what they have suggested (Replit) to run & submit your code. I switched to Replit and it worked instantly. Working through the problems now updating package.json and adding description, author, keywords, license, version.</p>
          <p>Day 4: Working through dependencies in package.json. Replit working well. People asked me why I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge? I am wanting to improve my backend skills and I am really curious.</p>
          <p>Day 5: About 50% through the first part of the course.</p>
