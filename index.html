         <h3>Free Code Camp Backend Challenges and a Commentary</h3>
         <p>Blog for #100DaysOfCode</p>
         <p>Day 1: Chose Freecodecamp and figured out I will do the backend course. Setup Git, Git Desktop, and Git pages.</p>
         <p>Day 2: Started with editing package.json on a backend challenge. I can't still figure out how to submit the challenge correctly.</p>
         <p>Day 3: Got my http://lpninja.github.io stack up and continuing to write here. Still stuck on their submission form. Have asked them. Smeagol responded. Apparently you cannot use static pages like Git Pages and need to use what they have suggested (Replit) to run & submit your code. I switched to Replit and it worked instantly. Working through the problems now updating package.json and adding description, author, keywords, license, version.</p>
         <p>Day 4: Working through dependencies in package.json. Replit working well. People asked me why I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge? I am wanting to improve my backend skills and I am really curious.</p>
         <p>Day 5: About 50% through the first part of the course. Dependencies again. Quote of the day - "It is not time to wake up the sheep, it is time to wake up the Lions!</p>
         <p>Day 6: Working on some new CSS syntax. Interesting, CSS has the ability to nearly make any shape or flat object. Snowboarding. </p>
         <p>Day 7: Stuck again and I can’t figure out if it is syntax or logical. Some of these dependency libraries are obscure possibly. I will check tomorrow. Blizzard running.</p>
         <p>Day 8: Got unstuck, was a silly syntax issue. Onwards. We have a serious blizzard ongoing here so coding is great. Watch out for falling snow (from rooftops).</p>
         <p>Day 9: Looking at semantic versioning. Luckily I already had gone over this a while back but it is great to refresh. Versioned a dependency in a package.json. Helped dig a random person's car out. #hokkaidolife</p>
         <p>Day 10: Infrastructure failure day and wasn't able to charge my laptop poperly. HTML only today. #hokkaidolife</p>
         <p>Day 11: Dependencies not being recognised in the solution checker for my repo. Have asked them why./p>
