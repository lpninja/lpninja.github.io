         <h3>Free Code Camp Backend Challenges and a Commentary</h3>
         <p>Blog for #100DaysOfCode</p>
         <p>Day 1: Chose Freecodecamp and figured out I will do the backend course. Setup Git, Git Desktop, and Git pages.</p>
         <p>Day 2: Started with editing package.json on a backend challenge. I can't still figure out how to submit the challenge correctly.</p>
         <p>Day 3: Got my http://lpninja.github.io stack up and continuing to write here. Still stuck on their submission form. Have asked them. Smeagol responded. Apparently you cannot use static pages like Git Pages and need to use what they have suggested (Replit) to run & submit your code. I switched to Replit and it worked instantly. Working through the problems now updating package.json and adding description, author, keywords, license, version.</p>
         <p>Day 4: Working through dependencies in package.json. Replit working well. People asked me why I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge? I am wanting to improve my backend skills and I am really curious.</p>
         <p>Day 5: About 50% through the first part of the course. Dependencies again. Quote of the day - "It is not time to wake up the sheep, it is time to wake up the Lions!</p>
         <p>Day 6: Working on some new CSS syntax. Interesting, CSS has the ability to nearly make any shape or flat object. Snowboarding. </p>
         <p>Day 7: Stuck again and I can’t figure out if it is syntax or logical. Some of these dependency libraries are obscure possibly. I will check tomorrow. Blizzard running.</p>
         <p>Day 8: Got unstuck, was a silly syntax issue. Onwards. We have a serious blizzard ongoing here so coding is great. Watch out for falling snow (from rooftops).</p>
         <p>Day 9: Looking at semantic versioning. Luckily I already had gone over this a while back but it is great to refresh. Versioned a dependency in a package.json. Helped dig a random person's car out. #hokkaidolife</p>
         <p>Day 10: Infrastructure failure day and wasn't able to charge my laptop properly. HTML only today. #hokkaidolife</p>
         <p>Day 11: Dependencies not being recognised in the solution checker for my repo. Have asked them why.</p>
         <p>Day 12: Found the error in my dependencies versioning. I was using "^2.10.2" instead of "2.10.2". e.g. Setting it to ^2.10.2 is not the same thing as setting it to 2.10.2. It is the difference between saying, “I want a scoop of vanilla, but if there are some sprinkles or whatever, that’s cool, as long as there’s a scoop of vanilla in there.” and saying, “I want a scoop of vanilla. Period.” Also figured out the use of the tilda character "~" to update to the latest version of a package. e.g. 2.10.x. Using the caret "^" character allows for both 2.x.x updates. Now completed this section and up to Node console. Console.log "Hello World" was written.</p>
         <p>Day 13: Node console and express. Writing some of my first javascript and looking at function syntax.</p>
         <p>Day 14: Functions in javascript. Snow walking. #hokkaidolife</p>
         <p>Day 15: console.log(variable); is working well. Paths and GET requests.</p>
         <p>Day 16: Serving Static Assets. Budling some test apps by serving HTML files. Looking at middleware next.</p>
         <p>Day 17: Successfully connected to Express (middleware) and served the HTML file. Now the HTML file references a CSS style file and now my login looks more stylish! Next steps would to be start learning the database connectors. I currently like the MERN stack. (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). We finally got to over 0 degrees here in Sapporo. #Hokkaidolife.</p>
         <p>Day 18: {"message":"Eat Bananas and Hello json"}- wow this updates fast. I am starting to play with JSON strings from myapp.js.</p>
         <p>Day 19: I am actually on a hardware and SD card failure mode easter egg hunt today so not much coding other than html. I also came across the possibility to keep IOT boot files on a server and do power cycling over POE but I haven't delved into it yet.</p>
         <p>Day 20: Stuck again on this .env setup. Working through it. </p>
         <p>Day 21: Still stuck, no coding. </p>
         <p>Day 22: Kind of less stuck, figure out how to transform strings with the operator .toUpperCase(); Replit and secrets tab (system environmental variables) functioning. </p>
         <p>Day 23: Doldrums, wow, can't seem to get my .env variable to change my JSON output. Is there a great bug finder editor for #javascript ?</p>
