         <p>Blog for #100DaysOfCode where <code>Day #:</code> is for coding challenge and <code>R&D:</code> is for research</p>
         <p><code>Day 1:</code> Chose Freecodecamp and figured out I will do the backend course. Setup Git, Git Desktop, and Git pages.</p>
         <p><code>Day 2:</code> Started with editing package.json on a backend challenge. I can't still figure out how to submit the challenge correctly.</p>
         <p><code>Day 3:</code> Got my github.io stack up and continuing to write here. Still stuck on their submission form. Have asked them. Smeagol responded. Apparently you cannot use static pages like Git Pages and need to use what they have suggested (Replit) to run & submit your code. I switched to Replit and it worked instantly. Working through the problems now updating package.json and adding description, author, keywords, license, version.</p>
         <p><code>Day 4:</code> Working through dependencies in package.json. Replit working well. People asked me why I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge? I am wanting to improve my backend skills and I am really curious.</p>
         <p><code>Day 5:</code> About 50% through the first part of the course. Dependencies again. Quote of the day - "It is not time to wake up the sheep, it is time to wake up the Lions!</p>
         <p><code>Day 6:</code> Working on some new CSS syntax. Interesting, CSS has the ability to nearly make any shape or flat object. Snowboarding. </p>
         <p><code>Day 7:</code> Stuck again and I can’t figure out if it is syntax or logical. Some of these dependency libraries are obscure possibly. I will check tomorrow. Blizzard running.</p>
         <p><code>Day 8:</code> Got unstuck, was a silly syntax issue. Onwards. We have a serious blizzard ongoing here so coding is great. Watch out for falling snow (from rooftops).</p>
         <p><code>Day 9:</code> Looking at semantic versioning. Luckily I already had gone over this a while back but it is great to refresh. Versioned a dependency in a package.json. Helped dig a random person's car out. #hokkaidolife</p>
         <p><code>Day 10:</code> Infrastructure failure day and wasn't able to charge my laptop properly. HTML only today. #hokkaidolife </p>
         <p><code>Day 11:</code> Dependencies not being recognised in the solution checker for my repo. Have asked them why.</p>
         <p><code>Day 12:</code> Found the error in my dependencies versioning. I was using "^2.10.2" instead of "2.10.2". e.g. Setting it to ^2.10.2 is not the same thing as setting it to 2.10.2. It is the difference between saying, “I want a scoop of vanilla, but if there are some sprinkles or whatever, that’s cool, as long as there’s a scoop of vanilla in there.” and saying, “I want a scoop of vanilla. Period.” Also figured out the use of the tilda character "~" to update to the latest version of a package. e.g. 2.10.x. Using the caret "^" character allows for both 2.x.x updates. Now completed this section and up to Node console. <code>console.log</code> "Hello World" was written.</p>
         <p><code>Day 13:</code> Node console and express. Writing some of my first javascript and looking at function syntax.</p>
         <p><code>Day 14:</code> Functions in javascript. Snow walking. #hokkaidolife </p>
         <p><code>Day 15:</code> console.log(variable); is working well. Paths and GET requests.</p>
         <p><code>Day 16:</code> Serving Static Assets. Budling some test apps by serving HTML files. Looking at middleware next.</p>
         <p><code>Day 17:</code> Successfully connected to Express (middleware) and served the HTML file. Now the HTML file references a CSS style file and now my login looks more stylish! Next steps would to be start learning the database connectors. I currently like the MERN stack. (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). We finally got to over 0 degrees here in Sapporo. #Hokkaidolife.</p>
         <p><code>Day 18:</code> <code>{"message":"Eat Bananas and Hello json"}</code>- wow this updates fast. I am starting to play with JSON strings from myapp.js.</p>
         <p><code>Day 19:</code> I am actually on a hardware and SD card failure mode easter egg hunt today so not much coding other than html. I also came across the possibility to keep IOT boot files on a server and do power cycling over POE but I haven't delved into it yet.</p>
         <p><code>Day 20:</code> Stuck again on this .env setup. Working through it. </p>
         <p><code>Day 21:</code> Still stuck, no coding. </p>
         <p><code>Day 22:</code> Kind of less stuck, figure out how to transform strings with the operator <code>.toUpperCase();</code> Replit and secrets tab (system environmental variables) functioning. </p>
         <p><code>Day 23:</code> Doldrums, wow, can't seem to get my .env variable to change my JSON output. Is there a great bug finder editor for #javascript ?</p>
         <p><code>Day 24:</code> .env and I need to get better at sequential coding and local variables. </p>
         <p><code>Day 25:</code> Got some good feedback and onto the next challenge.  </p>
         <p><code>Day 26:</code> Setting up NAT traversal. Stuck on the next challenge. </p>
         <p><code>Day 27:</code> Missed previous two days completely as I was recovering. Looking at next challenge. </p>
         <p><code>Day 28:</code> Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware. Trying out this challenge. </p>
         <p><code>Day 29:</code> Looking at this Express middleware challenge and not exactly sure why I would need it. I guess if there is something that needs to interupt a response pattern and execute conditionally. Like log GET, DELETE or PUT requests. </p>
         <p><code>Day 30:</code> Looking at loops <code>FOR & WHILE</code> today.</p>
         <p><code>Day 31:</code> Authorization using Middleware functions. <pre><code class="language-javascript">const authorizeRoute = (req,res,next) => {}</code></pre></p>
         <p><code>Day 32:</code> While loops. Seems very similar actually to what I wrote before in Java. e.g. <pre><code class="language-javascript">let n = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; }</code></pre> Snowboarding. It is getting late season now but the snow was still great. </p>
         <p><code>Day 33:</code> Back to .env variables.</p>
         <p><code>Day 34:</code> Realized I was coding wrong with the function "Let" and this was some good progress.</p>
         <p><code>Day 35:</code> Been struggling with an IF loop outcome lately. I am still learning a lot of the basic aspects of JavaScript.</p>
         <p><code>Day 36:</code> I seriously get stuck a lot. So I have finally figured out <code>CONST</code> and <code>LET</code> with the assignment of variables in scopes. So for example if I declare a <code>CONST</code> outside the curly brackets {} that <code>CONST</code> is usually meant to be a constant. Then I can declare the same <code>CONST</code> value inside the curly brackets {} and if I <code>console.log</code> inside the curly brackets I will get the new <code>CONST</code> value as the output and not the original <code>CONST</code> value that I originally declared. Now if I use <code>LET</code>  instead of <code>CONST</code> then I can say that LET is redefining a constant. </p>
         <p><code>R&D:</code> I found another interesting thread where a Bitcoin maxi describes the necessity of Proof-of-Work and there are some legitimate points <a href="https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1392826448017346561?s=20&t=zTTgQkmYbT4WLWQ7Tms7YA">here.</a> However this is a huge topic and it is multi-disciplinary, so I will document my results in this blog.</p>
         <p><code>Day 37:</code> Shipping out Datalogger products today to a customer so not much coding other than making my blog look more presentable. </p>
         <p><code>Day 38:</code> Ok, so I am still stuck on this <code>env</code>  variable checker function using <code>SECRETS</code> in Replit. I understand that it works differently in a normal setup when I can save my <code>env</code> files locally vs. using it in Replit. But I still think that there is some kind of problem with my actual code inside the handler function itself. Essentially by placing the line of code where you check the value of the environment variable outside of the handler function means that the environment variable is checked only once, when the application first starts.
         However, when you check the value of the environment variable inside the handler function, then you check the value of the environment variable every time the handler function is called.
         This difference is important because the test suite sends a command to the application to change the environment variable while the application is running. If you do not check the value of the environment variable inside of the handler, then it is literally impossible for the handler to respond to this change. (This is the part that got me...) Manually changing the environment variable involves restarting the application, which isn’t how the test suite works. It also isn’t how you would want a real world application to actually work. You shouldn’t need to restart the application to change this behavior.  </p>
         <p><code>R&D:</code> Great discussion about DAO's <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnxnkadAwEKO?s=20">here.</a> Worth a listen if you want to learn more about DAO's. One reminder, without the Proof-of-Work blockchain of Bitcoin backstopping the entire system, largely the multi-chain world would have a hard time functioning. Remember, Ethereum itself was started by a crowdraise from Bitcoin. That said, the multi-chain world we currently see may already be too big to fail but nobody knows for sure.</p>
         <p><code>Day 39:</code> I upgraded my setup here to VS Code and it is literally an amazing editor and studio. I was frustrated with the way that Replit treats <code>env </code> files with their <code>SECRETS</code> tab. I realised that if I am going to work on more complex server projects I should just run things locally here with terminal and the correct dependencies and environment files. </p>
         <p><code>R&D:</code> Blockchains as tools to represent more stakeholders in the global community state machine. The talk from Ethan Buchman on Cosmos, Tendermint and sovereignty within crypto is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwsxuGaaydU">here.</a> I am also in agreement with Ethan about Bitcoin with respect to its role as a thermodynamic anchor using Proof-of-work. I would prefer to tackle the problems that we are facing on the planet with Bitcoin at our back vs. not having it. That said, there are also interesting consensus algorithms that are being used in Cosmos and others. Tendermint is the operating system that runs the low level blockchain. Cosmos SDK is the toolkit that helps developers build applications on top of Tendermint and finally the inter blockchain communication protocol (IBC) is a way to connect to other blockchains. </p>
         <p><code>Day 40:</code> Recalibrated my GIT setup on another computer. I need to dive into the next challenge asap. </p>
         <p><code>Day 41:</code> Middleware with request, response and next. It is quickly occuring to me that middleware is a very powerful step in handling logins and all sorts of AUTH actions and logging. A great resource for express middleware is <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html">here</a>. </p>
         <p><code>Day 42:</code> Ok back at it after an extended break. Looking at some amazing implementations using Node.js. A good resource is <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/node/">here.</a> </p>
         <p><code>Day 43:</code> Simple middleware function without a mount path. e.g  <pre><code class="language-javascript"> app.use((req, res, next) => {console.log('Time:', Date.now()) next()})</code></pre> </p>
         <p><code>Day 44:</code> Loading a series of middleware functions at a mount point, with a mount path. It illustrates a middleware sub-stack that prints request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path. Kind of cool that you can specify the mount point. </p>
         <p><code>Day 45:</code> Got my loggers going on <code>console.log</code> with middleware. Now trying to see if this is pushing to JSON also with <code>res.json</code>. </p>
         <p><code>Day 46:</code> I was able to use the <code>res.json</code> output to form a JSON message of the outputs of my middleware. This was an interesting problem to solve. </p>
