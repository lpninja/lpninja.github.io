<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages. Ok finally. This will be my #100DaysOfCode blog, so please read if you're interested in backend, NodeJS, MongolDB, security and my learning process. I'll try to keep it short.</p>
<p>Day 1: Figured out that I would do the backend course of freecodecamp. Tried to send in my code but realised I need to make a live page for my app.</p>
<p>Day 2: Figured out how to make a live page for `https://github.com/lpninja/boilerplate-npm`.</p>
